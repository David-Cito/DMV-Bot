<h2>7-Day Appointment Availability Analysis</h2>
<div style="background: #f0f0f0; padding: 15px; margin: 15px 0; border-left: 4px solid #007acc;">
<h3>Metrics Explanation</h3>
<p>This analysis tracks appointments that become available within 7 days.</p>
<h4>Key Metrics:</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Availability Persistence:</strong> Percentage of appointments still available on the next check (5-30 min later). Higher = better chance to book.<br>
<strong>Interpretation:</strong> &gt;80% = Very stable, 60-80% = Moderate, &lt;60% = Highly competitive.</li>
<li><strong>Slot Count Trends:</strong> How many appointment slots appear at once when openings become available. More slots = better booking opportunity.<br>
<strong>Interpretation:</strong> Average &gt;5 = Good, 3-5 = Moderate, &lt;3 = Limited availability.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Date Availability:</strong> When appointments appear within 7 days, how often multiple dates appear at the same time. Higher % = more options.</li>
<li><strong>Cancellation Timing:</strong> Peak hours when cancellations occur (creating openings). Useful for timing checks when new appointments are likely.</li>
<li><strong>Lead Time Trends:</strong> Whether appointments are getting closer (better) or further out (worse) over time. Shows overall availability trends.</li>
<li><strong>Competition Indicators:</strong> How quickly appointments disappear after appearing. Faster = more competition.<br>
<strong>Interpretation:</strong> &lt;30 min = HIGH, 30-120 min = MODERATE, &gt;120 min = LOW competition.</li>
<li><strong>Duration Statistics:</strong> How long appointments stay available once they appear within 7 days. Longer durations = more time to book.<br>
<strong>Interpretation:</strong> &lt;1 hour = Very competitive, 1-6 hours = Competitive, &gt;6 hours = Less competitive.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Queue System Recommendations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check frequency:</strong> Keep current 5-minute interval</li>
<li><strong>Availability persistence:</strong> N/A% of appointments still available on next check</li>
<li><strong>Competition level:</strong> LOW (based on disappearance speed)</li>
<li><strong>Priority times:</strong> Focus checks during peak cancellation hours</li>
<li><strong>Multi-date strategy:</strong> Most events have single dates</li>
<li><strong>Alert threshold:</strong> Consider alerting on appointments <= 1 days out</li>
