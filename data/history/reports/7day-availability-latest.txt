7-Day Appointment Availability Analysis
========================================

Metrics Explanation:
-------------------
This analysis tracks appointments that become available within 7 days.
Data sources: Month history snapshots + Change history (captures same-day/short-lived appointments).

Key Metrics:
  1. Availability Persistence: Percentage of appointments still available
     on the next check (5-30 min later). Higher = better chance to book.
     >80% = Very stable, 60-80% = Moderate, <60% = Highly competitive.

  2. Slot Count Trends: How many appointment slots appear at once when
     openings become available. More slots = better booking opportunity.
     Average >5 = Good, 3-5 = Moderate, <3 = Limited availability.

  3. Multi-Date Availability: When appointments appear within 7 days, how
     often multiple dates appear at the same time. Higher % = more options.

  4. Cancellation Timing: Peak hours when cancellations occur (creating
     openings). Useful for timing checks when new appointments are likely.

  5. Lead Time Trends: Whether appointments are getting closer (better) or
     further out (worse) over time. Shows overall availability trends.

  6. Competition Indicators: How quickly appointments disappear after
     appearing. Faster = more competition. <30 min = HIGH, 30-120 min =
     MODERATE, >120 min = LOW competition.

  7. Duration Statistics: How long appointments stay available once they
     appear within 7 days. Longer durations = more time to book.
     <1 hour = Very competitive, 1-6 hours = Competitive, >6 hours = Less competitive.

  Response Time Guidance:
    Recommendation: System should respond within 30 minutes for best results

  Frequency by Location:
    Pearlridge: 2 instances
    Downtown: 1 instances
    Hawaii Kai: 1 instances

  Queue System Recommendations:
    1. Check frequency: Keep current 5-minute interval
    2. Availability persistence: N/A% of appointments still available on next check
    3. Competition level: LOW (based on disappearance speed)
    4. Priority times: Focus checks during peak cancellation hours
    5. Multi-date strategy: Most events have single dates
    6. Alert threshold: Consider alerting on appointments <= 1 days out
